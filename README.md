## This is a placeholder for DAUMOT code release. The code will be released in the following days.
## Official Implementation for DAUMOT: Domain Adaptation for Unsupervised Multiple Object Tracking <br />
** DAUMOT: Domain Adaptation for Unsupervised Multiple Object Tracking ** <br />

The idea was orignaited from Guillaume Delorme and he implemented the code for FairMOT-DAUMOT, Yihong finished the TransCenter-DAUMOT part.

Sample qualitative results from different sequences of MOT20 comparing direct transfer (i.e. no adaptation) to DAUMOT. (a) shows the persons missed by
direct transfer whereas (b) showcases over detections and (c,d) show person identity changes. The images illustrate the existence of large domain shifts between
source (MOT17) and target (MOT20) when the model is not trained with DAUMOT. Green arrows point to the errors.
